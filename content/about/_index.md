&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, I'm Zach! Thanks for visiting my site, where you can learn about me and sample some of my projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent the past 12+ years performing database management and predictive modeling, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of data analysis. I have always had an affinity for numbers, with exceptional mathematics and computer programming skills.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am fluent in several database management systems, have expertise in building predictive models using R and Python programming languages, and extensive experience with a variety of data visualization software. 
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work. I have strong communication skills with a knack for crafting clear and illuminating presentations. I am comfortable facing projects on my own, but I also enjoy working with motivated teams of talented people.
